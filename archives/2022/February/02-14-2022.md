            -   Faculty are less engaged as they don't have the pressure
                > to get students due to the fellowship

            -   Make their students interact with prospective students
                > (they should introduce their students)

        -   Make a master list of students ⇔ faculty as point of
            > contacts

        -   Research Labs organize events with interested students (like
            > dinner)

        -   Differential fee + Low salary make the offer letter look bad

        -   Add prospective students as "single channel guests" to the
            > SoC slack

        -   Advantages of the fellowship is not well advertised (on the
            > website, during the grad visit)

-   Later in the semester

    -   Improve QoL of incoming students

    -   Importance of getting a faculty for your first semester rotation

        > 4-5p Tue, Wed, and Thu. I can reschedule one of them,
        > depending on what date you choose.

        -   Keep it personal, otherwise keep it short

-   Grad Panels/Seminar: Applying for jobs in academia

    -   Pavel's feedback:

        -   I think for jobs in academia it's much better to focus on
            > junior profs, who have gone through the system recently.

        -   Someone like Rob does indeed have some specialized knowledge
            > of being research faculty, but his experience getting a
            > job is from a long time ago.

        -   That said I bet if you asked these faculty "do you think
            > you'd have something useful to say" you'd get useful
            > guidance.

        -   And senior faculty do see a lot of candidates go by, which
            > is useful knowledge too.

    -   Next steps: Reach out to faculty you have a connection with

        -   Panel: 1 person from teaching / research / younger -
            > currently applied / established - on the hiring committee
            > / from different levels ( assistant / associate / full ) /
            > Industry and came back
