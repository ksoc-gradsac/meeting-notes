    -   summary of data

        -   [*Slide*](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UXJui4TvgXl5ywdKJarH8lwTvUyWa5EKZlQbOcHaVyE/edit?usp=sharing)

            -   With inflation it has become very hard to keep up with
                > expenses. And unforeseen medical issues and visits
                > have made my financial situation unstable.

            -   A cost of living adjustment is definitely needed. My
                > stipend doesn\'t come close to covering my living
                > expenses. I work a full-time job in addition to my
                > research because there would be no way I could cover
                > my family\'s living expenses otherwise. While this
                > survey mostly covered housing expenses, I would also
                > like to point out increased child-care costs over the
                > past couple of years. Child-care is by far my second
                > largest expense after housing.

            -   Our salary was okay last year. But with the recent price
                > increase due to inflation, we cannot make any saving
                > (at least \~\$1400 required for semester fess and
                > health insurance).

            -   The rent price increase is the main problem. The
                > university doesn\'t have enough graduate housing (the
                > waiting line is more than a year). It forces people to
                > move far away from the campus, which ruins the ability
                > to participate in social events.\
                > The current total \$800 rent price is low, compared to
                > the market. I\'ve just moved, and any other available
                > option in reasonable condition was \$1600 for 2
                > bedroom without any utilities.
