                           * One semester as T.M.
                           * Other?
                           * Q: what is the learning reason for this
                           * Many consider the ability to teach is important for  a PhD
                           * T.M. support helps improve quality of classes
                           * Comment: one career outcome is to become a faculty. Ability to each is important. Lack of teaching culture in CS is weird. (Math PhD teach a full class every semester)
                           * Comment: maybe don‚Äôt need to tweak policy for sanctioned students.
                           * We already do something special for them. We could keep that exception.
                           * Comment: TA wouldn‚Äôt be different than T.M. has the advantage of not requiring students to register for credits (tuition diff, tuition benefit etc)
                           * Comment: will still have PhD students help teaching in a way that teach them how to teach. There is a concern with the student/TA ratio.
                           * Comment: we are allowing a sanctioned PhD student to graduate. Therefore we are assuming that they are responsible enough to graduate, therefore aren‚Äôt they responsible enough to be a TA?
                           * Devin thought: How many PhD students are sanctioned? 1%? 5%? More? (it sounds like the answer is 0.5%)
                           * Sanctioned students cannot do anything student-facing wrt grading, but could still be a TA.
                           * Comment: we are discussing the burden of requiring a single TA, but we are currently requiring 2 TMs, so one TA is actually less of a requirement?

                              * With inflation it has become very hard to keep up with expenses. And unforeseen medical issues and visits have made my financial situation unstable.
                              * A cost of living adjustment is definitely needed. My stipend doesn't come close to covering my living expenses. I work a full-time job in addition to my research because there would be no way I could cover my family's living expenses otherwise. While this survey mostly covered housing expenses, I would also like to point out increased child-care costs over the past couple of years. Child-care is by far my second largest expense after housing.
                              * Our salary was okay last year. But with the recent price increase due to inflation, we cannot make any saving (at least ~$1400 required for semester fess and health insurance).
                              * The rent price increase is the main problem. The university doesn't have enough graduate housing (the waiting line is more than a year). It forces people to move far away from the campus, which ruins the ability to participate in social events.
The current total $800 rent price is low, compared to the market. I've just moved, and any other available option in reasonable condition was $1600 for 2 bedroom without any utilities.
                                 * Retreat: August 18th

Perhaps you can tell me how many total attendance it would be ‚Äî we may need to limit how many continuing graduate students since we will be picking up a lot of international prospective students. ‚Äú

                                                   * Mary: ‚ÄúRegarding the videographer, it is not the expense that worries me, but just finding someone to do it on such short notice and organizing what they do.  Also, right now our spaces are not going to impress anyone.  Even the very cool things we are doing do not look good right now. This would be a great idea with the new building.  Last year, I think it was BioE that had some students rent a golf cart and take a very unprofessional but fun video of campus on their phones.  I think campus is more impressive than the interiors of our buildings because the views are spectacular, and you can drive past places like the Student Life Center.    But we would need a few volunteers to pull this off.‚Äú
