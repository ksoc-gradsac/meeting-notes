    -   FAR --- faculty activity report. Report on what faculty have
        > done in the last year.

        -   Not very relevant to us

-   Rajeev

    -   Phd teaching requirements

        -   Past 35 / 4, yes/no for one TA requirement vote

        -   Note: Sanctioned students cannot currently be hired as TAs

        -   New "menu of options"

            -   One sem as TA

            -   B or higher in CS 6961

            -   One semester as T.M.

            -   Other?

        -   Q: what is the learning reason for this

            -   Many consider the ability to teach is important for a
                > PhD

            -   T.M. support helps improve quality of classes

        -   Comment: one career outcome is to become a faculty. Ability
            > to each is important. Lack of teaching culture in CS is
            > weird. (Math PhD teach a full class every semester)

        -   Comment: maybe don't need to tweak policy for sanctioned
            > students.

            -   We already do something special for them. We could keep
                > that exception.

        -   Comment: TA wouldn't be different than T.M. has the
            > advantage of not requiring students to register for
            > credits (tuition diff, tuition benefit etc)

        -   Comment: will still have PhD students help teaching in a way
            > that teach them how to teach. There is a concern with the
            > student/TA ratio.

        -   Comment: we are allowing a sanctioned PhD student to
            > graduate. Therefore we are assuming that they are
            > responsible enough to graduate, therefore aren't they
            > responsible enough to be a TA?

        -   Devin thought: How many PhD students are sanctioned? 1%? 5%?
            > More? (it sounds like the answer is **0.5%**)

        -   Sanctioned students cannot do anything student-facing wrt
            > grading, but could still be a TA.

        -   Comment: we are discussing the burden of requiring a single
            > TA, but we are currently requiring 2 TMs, so one TA is
            > actually less of a requirement?

        -   Comment: In the last five years there was one PhD sanction.

    -   Differential tuition / fees

        -   PIs/ksoc will cover diff tuition for RA/GAs

        -   Will not cover health insurance

        -   SCI is covering health insurance and international fee

        -   Comment: we are paying less than sci, how can we compete? We
            > used to be able to pay ourselves, but aren't allowed to
            > anymore. (we technically weren't allowed before either)

    -   summary of data

            -   With inflation it has become very hard to keep up with
                > expenses. And unforeseen medical issues and visits
                > have made my financial situation unstable.

            -   A cost of living adjustment is definitely needed. My
                > stipend doesn\'t come close to covering my living
                > expenses. I work a full-time job in addition to my
                > research because there would be no way I could cover
                > my family\'s living expenses otherwise. While this
                > survey mostly covered housing expenses, I would also
                > like to point out increased child-care costs over the
                > past couple of years. Child-care is by far my second
                > largest expense after housing.

            -   Our salary was okay last year. But with the recent price
                > increase due to inflation, we cannot make any saving
                > (at least \~\$1400 required for semester fess and
                > health insurance).

            -   The rent price increase is the main problem. The
                > university doesn\'t have enough graduate housing (the
                > waiting line is more than a year). It forces people to
                > move far away from the campus, which ruins the ability
                > to participate in social events.\
                > The current total \$800 rent price is low, compared to
                > the market. I\'ve just moved, and any other available
                > option in reasonable condition was \$1600 for 2
                > bedroom without any utilities.

        -   More involvement from the faculty during the Grad Visit

            -   Faculty are less engaged as they don't have the pressure

            -   Make their students interact with prospective students
                > (they should introduce their students)

        -   Make a master list of students ⇔ faculty as point of
            > contacts

        -   Research Labs organize events with interested students (like
            > dinner)

        -   Differential fee + Low salary make the offer letter look bad

        -   Add prospective students as "single channel guests" to the

        -   Advantages of the fellowship is not well advertised (on the

-   Grad Panels/Seminar: Applying for jobs in academia

    -   Pavel's feedback:

        -   I think for jobs in academia it's much better to focus on
            > junior profs, who have gone through the system recently.

        -   Someone like Rob does indeed have some specialized knowledge
            > of being research faculty, but his experience getting a
            > job is from a long time ago.

        -   That said I bet if you asked these faculty "do you think
            > you'd have something useful to say" you'd get useful
            > guidance.

        -   And senior faculty do see a lot of candidates go by, which
            > is useful knowledge too.

    -   Next steps: Reach out to faculty you have a connection with
