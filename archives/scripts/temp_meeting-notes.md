# Feb 6, 2023 -- faculty meeting

## Attendees:

Devin, faculty

## Notes:

  * Hiring

  * Finished screening, shortlisted three, all local (I think for teaching)
  * Sci vis position open (3 visiting next week), these would be CS
  * Fyi (inviting 1 for SCI/psychology)

  * Mary

  * 50th anniversary/ IEEE milestone

  * 50 years since forming of CS department
  * Fri March 24

  * Telle whitney: keynote
  * David hanscom and Joe Zachary
  * Networking: Emulab (moderated by Rob Ricci)
  * Architecture: Duane CAll, Al Davis, Chuck Seltz
  * Assistant prof video and maybe a grad student video?

  * They will record during the poster session, and may use some of that if it turns out well

  * Ivan Sutherland: keynote

  * FAR -- faculty activity report. Report on what faculty have done in the last year.

  * Not very relevant to us

  * Rajeev

  * Phd teaching requirements

  * Past 35 / 4,  yes/no for one TA requirement vote
  * Note: Sanctioned students cannot currently be hired as TAs
  * New "menu of options"

  * One sem as TA
  * B or higher in CS 6961
  * One semester as T.M.
  * Other?

  * Q: what is the learning reason for this

  * Many consider the ability to teach is important for  a PhD
  * T.M. support helps improve quality of classes

  * Comment: one career outcome is to become a faculty. Ability to each is important. Lack of teaching culture in CS is weird. (Math PhD teach a full class every semester)
  * Comment: maybe don't need to tweak policy for sanctioned students.

  * We already do something special for them. We could keep that exception.

  * Comment: TA wouldn't be different than T.M. has the advantage of not requiring students to register for credits (tuition diff, tuition benefit etc)
  * Comment: will still have PhD students help teaching in a way that teach them how to teach. There is a concern with the student/TA ratio.
  * Comment: we are allowing a sanctioned PhD student to graduate. Therefore we are assuming that they are responsible enough to graduate, therefore aren't they responsible enough to be a TA?
  * Devin thought: How many PhD students are sanctioned? 1%? 5%? More? (it sounds like the answer is 0.5%)
  * Sanctioned students cannot do anything student-facing wrt grading, but could still be a TA.
  * Comment: we are discussing the burden of requiring a single TA, but we are currently requiring 2 TMs, so one TA is actually less of a requirement?
  * Comment: In the last five years there was one PhD sanction.

  * Differential tuition / fees

  * PIs/ksoc will cover diff tuition for RA/GAs
  * Will not cover health insurance
  * SCI is covering health insurance and international fee
  * Comment: we are paying less than sci, how can we compete? We used to be able to pay ourselves, but aren't allowed to anymore. (we technically weren't allowed before either)

  * summary of data

  * [Slide](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UXJui4TvgXl5ywdKJarH8lwTvUyWa5EKZlQbOcHaVyE/edit?usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1702074041337130&usg=AOvVaw2f5H_603Lgxhxhj0H6Qa9d)

  * With inflation it has become very hard to keep up with expenses. And unforeseen medical issues and visits have made my financial situation unstable.
  * A cost of living adjustment is definitely needed. My stipend doesn't come close to covering my living expenses. I work a full-time job in addition to my research because there would be no way I could cover my family's living expenses otherwise. While this survey mostly covered housing expenses, I would also like to point out increased child-care costs over the past couple of years. Child-care is by far my second largest expense after housing.
  * Our salary was okay last year. But with the recent price increase due to inflation, we cannot make any saving (at least ~$1400 required for semester fess and health insurance).
  * The rent price increase is the main problem. The university doesn't have enough graduate housing (the waiting line is more than a year). It forces people to move far away from the campus, which ruins the ability to participate in social events.  
The current total $800 rent price is low, compared to the market. I've just
moved, and any other available option in reasonable condition was $1600 for 2
bedroom without any utilities.

  * Retreat: August 18th

  * Utah trivia

  * Game night
  * Mary: "Given that we are not paying for folks to travel or eat here, I think a Virtual Escape Room sounds fun.  Perhaps you can tell me how many total attendance it would be -- we may need to limit how many continuing graduate students since we will be picking up a lot of international prospective students. "

  * Videos

  * Mary: "Regarding the videographer, it is not the expense that worries me, but just finding someone to do it on such short notice and organizing what they do.  Also, right now our spaces are not going to impress anyone.  Even the very cool things we are doing do not look good right now. This would be a great idea with the new building.  Last year, I think it was BioE that had some students rent a golf cart and take a very unprofessional but fun video of campus on their phones.  I think campus is more impressive than the interiors of our buildings because the views are spectacular, and you can drive past places like the Student Life Center.    But we would need a few volunteers to pull this off."

  * This is something that could be done after the info session

  * Chris Coleman is the best contact for promo videos.
  * Single page agenda with all relevant links for both faculty and students

  * Grad Panels/Seminar: Applying for jobs in academia

  * Pavel's feedback: 

  * I think for jobs in academia it's much better to focus on junior profs, who have gone through the system recently.
  * Someone like Rob does indeed have some specialized knowledge of being research faculty, but his experience getting a job is from a long time ago.
  * That said I bet if you asked these faculty "do you think you'd have something useful to say" you'd get useful guidance.
  * And senior faculty do see a lot of candidates go by, which is useful knowledge too.

  * Next steps: Reach out to faculty you have a connection with
