## Bei Wang - Sabbatical Talk
## Kate
- PhD Student Fellowship check-in forms are due ASAP
	- reminder that spring 2025 is a normal (not trial) semester
- Course Assignments for TA
	- current method not sustainable, too much work on TA assigners
	- students need to respond to them better
- New Process:
	1. student + advisor need to find a course to TA in the **TA portal**
	2. if one can't be found, talk to teaching area coordinator
	3. still nothing, talk to Kate and Danny (current TA heads) but need documentation of steps 1 and 2
- If a student can't find a TA this way, they might not get one! It's a joint Student/Advisor responsibility.
- PhD students *can* talk to other faculty members and ask if they need TAs for their classes, MS students *cannot*.
- If you're doing a TF/TM, make sure to mark as such on the TA portal
